Date_collected: International format (YYYY-MM-DD), date leaves were collected in the field and scanned in the lab, followed by 72 hours of drying

Collector_1, Collector_2, etc.: Name of person or multiple columns of
    people who collected leaves. Everyone in the field party is an observer.

N_leaves: number of leaves collected from each individual plant 

Species: Full Latin binomial of species observed. No common names or
    abbreviations - EVER. In the format "Genus species". Only species 		whose leaves were collected for are listed here. Each species listed represents one individual of that species who's leaves were collected

Bag_label: "Plot_id-sp_num-individual_lower_case_letter" Each individual 	leaves were collected from is labeled by the:
	Plot_id: Code number of plot following triad format. Starting with 		outer-most triad and working in from there.
	sp_num: Unique number associated with a given species in a given 	plot. Used to associate leaf collections with species and associated scans.
	individual_lower_case_letter: Each individual of a given species was also given a lower case letter identifier a-e.

Date_weighed: International format (YYYY-MM-DD), date leaves were weighed in the lab.

Weigher: Name of person who weighed the leaves

Leaf_mass_g: Leaf mass in grams

Petiole_mass_g: Petiole mass if separated from leaf and weighed separately

Notes: Information about state of the leaves when collected - especially if it might influence SLA (herbivory, senescense, shade leaf, etc.) and any adjusments to normal protocol

Scans: The filename of the scan associated with each individual leaf sample. Some scans included more than one individual and thus their name will be present for more than one individual. Some individuals required more than one scan and these are noted with capital letters in the scan name after the individual lower case letter.
